## Description
This application was built to showcase my best projects. <br>
It lets potential employers know what I can do. <br>
It is heavily inspired from my old portfolio from the beginning of the Course. <br>
You can check it out here https://magjoker.github.io/what-happened/
https://github.com/magjoker/hot-wind-blows is the OG repo for this project. <br>
I switched to a new repo because I thought I ruined that repo.
